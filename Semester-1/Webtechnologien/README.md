# Web Technologies Projects

This repository contains various projects and assignments developed during my *Web Technologies* course, with a focus on building modern, responsive, and user-friendly websites.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- PHP
- Bootstrap 5

## ðŸ“Œ Semester Project: Responsive Hotel Website

As part of the final project, I developed a fully responsive hotel website that adapts to different screen sizes and devices. The project includes:

- Multi-page structure (Home, Rooms, Contact, etc.)
- Responsive layout using Bootstrap
- Custom styling with CSS
- Form handling and server-side logic with PHP
- Semantic HTML and mobile-first design principles

The goal was to simulate a real-world hotel website with focus on usability, clean structure, and responsive performance.
