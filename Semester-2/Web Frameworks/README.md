# Web Frameworks – MEAN Stack Development

This repository documents work completed during the *Web Frameworks* course, focused on developing modern web applications using the MEAN stack: **MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js**.

## Technologies

- **MongoDB** – Document-based NoSQL database, optimized for JSON-like data handling
- **Express.js** – Minimal and flexible backend framework built on Node.js
- **Angular** – Component-based frontend framework powered by TypeScript
- **Node.js** – JavaScript runtime for scalable server-side development
- **TypeScript** – Strongly typed JavaScript superset for fullstack development
- **Angular Material** – UI library for responsive, modern frontend design

## Learning Objectives

- Design and implement maintainable web applications using the MEAN architecture  
- Apply TypeScript consistently across frontend and backend  
- Understand RESTful API design and client-server communication  
- Connect frontend and backend layers in a fullstack environment  
- Develop and evaluate web and mobile-ready software architectures  
- Apply best practices in frontend UI design using Angular Material

> The MEAN stack allows consistent, full-featured JavaScript development across the entire application stack – from data storage to UI. This course provided the foundation for building scalable, modular, and efficient web applications with modern tooling.
